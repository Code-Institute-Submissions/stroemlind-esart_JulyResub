# E.Stromlind Art (ESART)
![E.Stromlind](documentation/images/e.stromlind.jpeg)

ES Art is the name of the web application for E.Strömlind art & posters. 
E.Strömlind takes the colorful and vibrant moments in life and makes them abstract and easy for the eye. The inspiration for the posters comes from different types of photos, like concert pictures, fashion editorials from magazines, or random everyday life pictures. All the posters are handmade on acrylic paper, drawn with pen and different types of markers.
This web application exists to display and get the customer a view and an easy way to purchase posters directly or make a request. 
Note: The creator of this web application is the owner of all the images used.

### SEO and Keywords
The keyword research process begins with browsing through other web applications and shops that sell posters. After going through many web applications, brainstorming begins for general topics that would fit the content and purpose of the website.
Some of the web applications from the research process:
* [Wall og Art](https://wallofart.com/)
* [Postery](https://www.postery.com/se/)
* [Poster Store](https://posterstore.se/)
* [Papertown](https://papertown.se/)
* [pstr Studio](https://www.pstrstudio.com/)
* [The Poster Club](https://theposterclub.com/)
* [Artsy Fartsy](https://artsyfartsy.se/)

* Topics: 
  * Print
  * Art
  * Posters
  * Home decoration
  * Wall decoration
  * Painting
  * housewarming gifts

Chosen Topics for this project are: 
* Art 
* Wall decoration
* Painting

* Keywords:
  * Art: posters, print, black and white, handmade, design, artist, painter
  * Wall decoration: frames, home decoration, homestyle, create a wall with art
  * Painting: Print, photography, poster, on the wall, meaning, exclusive 

The web application users and potential customers get identified by answering the following question from the web marketing lessons via Code Institute.
* Who are your users?
A person who has an interest in art, interior design, and home decore 
Someone who wants an easy way to make changes to their home
Someone who wants to give a unique gift to someone 

* Which online platforms would you find lots of your users on? Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?
Yes, they will be on social media to get inspiration, and some of them may use social media to shop directly. 
  * Instagram
  * Facebook
  * Pinterest
  * TikTok(Unsure, in need to get more information about the customer before deciding)

* What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?
They need a site that gives the users inspirational content on how they could use the posters. They could mix and match more posters from the site and get a unique portrait of them or other family members or friends. Get ideas for gifts for someone, like a home warming gift.

* Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?
Yes, the business would offer some sales maybe once or twice a year. There would not be many sales occasions or discounts to make it unique and align with the business concept. If it is unique and gives the customer what they are after, they will buy it at a price offered.

* What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?
The goal is to create unique and personal art for people to create a private atmosphere at home or for someone to give as a personal gift to someone. 
Social media channels will be at the center of this to achieve this. Create content like creating your picture wall or how a customer could use the art instead of photos.

* Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low-cost options to market itself?
From the start, it would need to do a lot of free or low-cost options in marketing because it is a small independent business focusing on personal art.

![Order History box 2](documentation/testing/desk-profile.png)

### Features Left to Implement

* A feature left to implement for the future would be to wire up the application to Amazon AWS3 and create a front-end feature to add new posters to the shop and website.

* The usage of white noise for this project makes the attached images with the request form not get stored in the database. The next step is to set up the project to an image storage database, like Cloudinary or Amazon AWS3 service.

* Add the Like button and add to cart button on the poster page for each poster to give the users a smoother shopping and user experience.

* Add Single sign-on with social accounts for the users to easily create and access purchases and a user profile.

* Add the functionality for users to be able to delete their registered accounts.

## Testing
To view all tests for this project, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* Go to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) site, [sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/login) for free if you do not already have an account.
    * If creating an account, fill in the signup form with name.
* On the dashboard page, navigate to the Create New App button and click.
* Give the app a unique name; it can not have the same name as another app, choose the region you are currently located in and select Create app.
* Go to the Resources tab and select add a database. In the add-ons box, search for Postgres. Select Heroku Postgres and click Submit Order Form.
* On the apps dashboard page, navigate to the Settings tab.
* On the Settings page, go down to the config vars section. 
* Create the following config vars:
  * Set the key to `DATABASE_URL`, value to `Provided-postgres-link`, and click add. 
  * Set the key to `SECRET_KEY`, value to `Your-SECRET_KEY`, and click add. 
  * Set the key to `DEBUG`, value to `True`, and click add. 
  * Set the key to `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`, value to `1`, and click add.
  * Set the key to `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, value to `Your-STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY_API`, and click add.
  * Set the key to `CLIENT_SECRET`, value to `Your-STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_API`, and click add.

Note: Remove DEBUG and DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC before the final deployment. Also remember to have the env.py file in the **.gitignore** file before the first deployment. So no value information will be visible after deployment.

* To obtain a Stripe key (For this project Stripe is set in Test mode)
  * Go to the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/home) site, [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for free if you do not already have an account. 
    * If creating an account, fill in the signup form with email, name, country and password.
  * On the dashboard page, navigate to the Developer button and click. Make sure that the test-mode is on.
  * On the Developer menu, navigate to the API-Keys button and click.
  * Retrive the Publishable key api code.
  * Retrive the Secret Key API by clicking on the reveal Test Key.
    * Make sure that the API keys begins with 'pk_test_...' and 'sk_test_...'.

Note: Remember to have the env.py file and have it in the **.gitignore** file before the first deployment. So no value information will be visible after deployment. Add the Stripes API Keys to the env.py file and set the variables from the env.py file in the settings.py file. 

* To obtain a PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL 
  * Install the supporting libraries by typing in the command 'pip3 install dj_database_url pyscopg2'
  * When done, type in the command `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` in the terminal
  * In the env.py file, import os. 
  *  Setup the following environment variable: 
      DATABASE_URL and paste in the DATABASE_URL from Heroku.
      ```os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'postgres://***************'```

  * In the settings.py file, import os dj_database_url.
    So scroll down to the DATABASES section and comment out the entire section. 
    Below the comment out section, add in the following code: 
    ```DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}```

* Navigate to the Deploy tab and down to the section called Deployment method. 
* Select GitHub and confirm the connection between Heroku and GitHub.
* Search for the project's repository name on GitHub and click "connect" to link GitHub with Heroku.
* On the same page, scroll down and choose how to deploy the app. For this project, automatic deploys are selected and enabled.
* Create a **Procfile** for Heroku, inside the file insert the following line:
    - `web: gunicorn cosmos.wsgi`
    * Note that cosmos is the name for this app.
    
* Create a **requirements.txt** file for Heroku, using the following command:
    - `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
